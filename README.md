# üéµ Capuchin Bird Call Detection System

## ü¶ú About the Capuchin Bird

The Capuchin Bird (Perissocephalus tricolor), also known as the Calfbird, is a fascinating species found in the Amazon rainforest. This unique bird is named after the Capuchin monks due to its distinctive bare head that resembles the monks' brown habits.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Size**: Medium-sized bird, approximately 33 cm (13 inches) in length
- **Appearance**: Distinguished by its bare, dark gray head and neck, with olive-brown plumage
- **Habitat**: Primarily inhabits humid lowland forests in South America, particularly in the Amazon Basin
- **Distribution**: Found in countries including Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, and Venezuela
- **Vocalization**: Known for its remarkable calls that sound similar to a distant cow's moo or a deep horn-like sound
- **Behavior**: Generally solitary birds, most active during dawn and dusk
- **Diet**: Primarily frugivorous, feeding on various forest fruits and berries

## üîç Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based system for detecting Capuchin bird calls in audio recordings. The system utilizes advanced audio processing techniques and neural networks to identify the unique vocalizations of these fascinating birds.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

1. **Audio Processing Pipeline**:
   - Loads audio files using librosa library
   - Converts audio into mel spectrograms for analysis
   - Preprocesses data to match the model's input requirements
   - Utilizes a trained deep learning model for classification

2. **User Interface**:
   - Built with Streamlit for an intuitive, web-based experience
   - Supports multiple audio file uploads
   - Provides real-time processing and feedback
   - Displays confidence scores for detections

### üíª How It Works

1. **Audio Input**:
   - Users can upload multiple audio files (WAV or MP3 format)
   - Files are temporarily stored in an 'uploads' directory
   - Each file is processed individually

2. **Processing Steps**:
   ```python
   # Audio preprocessing
   - Load audio file using librosa
   - Generate mel spectrogram
   - Resize to target shape (1491, 257)
   - Prepare for model input
   ```

3. **Model Prediction**:
   - Preprocessed audio is fed into the trained model
   - Model generates confidence scores
   - Scores above 50% indicate positive detection

4. **Results Display**:
   - Audio player for each uploaded file
   - Visual confidence indicators
   - Color-coded results (green for detected, red for not detected)
   - Summary of all processed files

### üéØ Output Interpretation

The system provides results in several formats:

1. **Individual File Results**:
   ```
   Processing file: example.wav
   CAPUCHIN BIRD CALL FOUND (Confidence: 85.32%)
   ```

2. **Summary Report**:
   ```
   üìä Summary of Results
   example1.wav: Capuchin Bird Call Found with 85.32% confidence
   example2.wav: No Capuchin Bird Call Found with 92.45% confidence
   ```

### üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit librosa numpy keras tensorflow
   ```

2. **Running the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Using the Interface**:
